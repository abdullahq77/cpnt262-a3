## Struggles/obstacles and notes
This assignment seemed pretty easy, but it turned out to be one of the hardest ones for me so far. I ran into many errors
and I believe it was because of the way I named my files. I reviewed the recordings and that helped a lot.
After I renamed my folders without any spaces I stopped running into the errors. This assignment forced me to use the 
command line which I don't use often, so that also made me learn new things.
